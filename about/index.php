				<h2>Current</h2>	
				<p>I'm a Worldwide Developer Evangelist for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>.  
				My job basically entails me traveling the world and 
				talking about the developer tools and technologies that Adobe has to offer or that we support. 
				To find out more, see about my <a href="/job">Job</a>. 
				</p>
				
				<p>I'm also the author of <em>Driving Technical Change.</em> It's about convinving reluctant co-workers 
				to adopt new tools and techniques.  To find out more, see about my <a href="/book">Book</a>. </p>
				
				
				
				<h2>Past</h2>
				<p>I went to University of Pennsylvania, and received a Bachelors of Art in Psychology.  While I was in school, I started 
				working in various Psychiatric clinical practices.  Gradually I shifted from psychological work to computing work. By the 
				time I got out of school, my desire to do psychology was gone, and there were tons of tech jobs available.</p>
				<p>I started out of school working at the Wharton School of Business. I moved from tech support to server admin to 
				system programmer to developer.  After 10 years there, I had done just about every technical job there is to do, and 
				decided programming was where I belonged. </p>
				
				
				<h2>Site</h2>
				<h3>Front End</h3>
				<p>This is my second attempt at building a semantic HTML5 site.</p>
				<p>I use Typekit to render <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/myriad-pro-condensed">Myriad Pro Condensed</a> 
				as a the header font and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/adobe-caslon-pro">Adobe Caslon Pro</a> for the copy font. </p>
			 
				
				
				<h3>Tools</h3>
				<p>I used <a href="http://browserlab.adobe.com">Browser Lab</a> to get the site working cross platform/browser.</p>	
				<p>The site was composed using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/">Fireworks CS5</a>.</p>
				<p>The code was written using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> 
					and <a href="http://www.brackets.io">Brackets</a>.</p>
				<p>I also used <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> to speed up my CSS work.</p>
