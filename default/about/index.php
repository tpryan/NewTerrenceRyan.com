			<p>I'm a Developer Advocate for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>. 
			My job is to extol the virtues of Google's Cloud Computing tools, and to talk to customers, 
			potential customers, and critics to get feedback to the make the platform better.</p> 


			<h2>Past</h2>
			<p>I used to be a Developer Evangelist for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, traveling 
			the world and talking about the developer tools and technologies that Adobe had to offer. 
			</p>
			
			<p>I'm also the author of <em>Driving Technical Change.</em> It's about convincing reluctant co-workers 
			to adopt new tools and techniques.  To find out more, see about my <a href="/book">Book</a>. </p>
			
			<p>I went to University of Pennsylvania, and received a Bachelors of Art in Psychology.  While I was in school, I started 
			working in various Psychiatric clinical practices.  Gradually I shifted from psychological work to computing work. By the 
			time I got out of school, my desire to do psychology was gone, and there were tons of tech jobs available.</p>
			<p>I started out of school working at the Wharton School of Business. I moved from tech support to server admin to 
			system programmer to developer.  After 10 years there, I had done just about every technical job there is to do, and 
			decided programming was where I belonged. </p>
