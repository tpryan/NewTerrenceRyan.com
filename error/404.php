	<p>I know, you used to go to this page <em>all the time</em> back in the day. Then it got trendy, and over crowded
		with lame people who listen to Coldplay.  And now it's gone.  Gone!  All because you couldn't keep it a secret. 
		You have only yourself to blame.</p>
	<p>On a more helpful note, perhaps you should try a <a href="/search">search</a>, or start over again at the <a href="/">main page</a>.</p>
