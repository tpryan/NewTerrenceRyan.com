		<h2>Driving Technical Change</h2>
		<p>Ever go to a technology conference, read a coding book, or just get inspired by a 
		blog post to try something new? You try it, you love it, you want everyone else at 
		work to do it. 
		</p>
		<p>Everyone else says "No- not just no, hell no!"</p> 
		<p>It's easy to blame your coworkers. But the responsibility lies with you. If 
		something is great, and your coworkers aren't buying, then you need to up your game.</p> 
		<p>I had this problem. I worked through it. I started changing what I did. If it 
		worked, I did it more. </p> 
		<p>I started recording what I was doing and started shaping it into a presentation and 
		a book.</p> 
		<p>In a moment of hubris, I pitched the book to 
		<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">
		    Pragmatic Bookshelf
		</a>
		. In a moment of luck they picked it up. In many moments of staring at a blank 
		screen, I wrote it. 
		</p> 
		<p>
		Now it's in 
		<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/trevan/driving-technical-change">print</a>.
		</p> 
		<p>
		I sincerely hope that what's in the book helps people change their workplaces for the 
		better.

		<h2>Reader Comments</h2> 
		<blockquote><p>At its core, <em>Driving Technical Change</em> is a fantastic book about design patterns. In it, Terrence Ryan clearly outlines common, problematic personalities&mdash;"skeptics" &mdash;and provides proven solutions for bringing about progressive change. It is certainly an unfortunate fact of human behavior that people are oftentimes resistant to implementing best practices; however, using Terry's book as a guide, you will now be able to identify why people push back against change and what you can do to remain successful in the face of adversity.</p></blockquote>

		<blockquote><p>Politics is one of the most challenging and underestimated subjects in the field of technology. Terrence Ryan has tackled this problem courageously and with a methodical approach. His book can help you understand many types of resistance (both rational and irrational) and make a strategy for getting people on board with your technology vision.</p></blockquote>

		<blockquote><p>Ryan combines the eye of an engineer, the insight of a psychotherapist, and the experience of a soldier in the trenches to provide a flowchart approach to your most immediate problem, as well as a fascinating overview of how to be more productive and less frustrated with your technical work. <em>Driving Technical Change</em> speaks in the language of the people who have the most to learn from Ryan's success with organizational management.</p></blockquote>

Terrence Ryan manages to create a fun and easy-to-read narrative with examples so accurate and familiar they that will often leave you wondering whether he was sitting next to you in a recent office meeting.</p></blockquote>
