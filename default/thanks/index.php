        <h2>Introduction to Firebase</h2>

        <p>We did an overview of Firebase. What is it? Why would you use it? And a little bit of history.
            Then we did a hands on lab where we created a chat client together. After that we talked about
            where to go next, what platforms Firebase supported, and what other tools you can use in your Firebase apps.
            Finally, we talked about when to consider Firebase, and when not to and we talked about where you could get help.
